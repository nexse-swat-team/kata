Java Code Katas
=========

This project hosts java katas, exercises to practice coding.

To solve the katas, search for the string TODO in the project:

    $ git clone git://github.com/nexse-swat-team/kata.git
    $ cd kata
    $ grep -r TODO .

Implement the missing parts, then run:

    $ mvn test

Unit tests will run making sure your implementation is correct.

If you wish to share your solutions, fork the project using GitHub's
fork button: this will create your own repository that you can use to
clone from and commit into.

Enjoy!
